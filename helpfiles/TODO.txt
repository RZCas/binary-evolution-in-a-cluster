0. Small general advice  - if you want to quickly test something or add something you are not sure you will keep, make a new branch for that. It's better than keeping commented out pieces of code, branches can easily be merged if needed or deleted if definitely not needed.

1. Cosmetic changes - get rid of import *, so that people can easily see where the function comes from,
write comments to almost every line which should be understood by anyone (even you will forget what you've written after a few months)

2.  Main task for now - figure out how to make sure that inbult MPI Nbody function runs on 1 core. It might be it actually cannot and asks for at least 2, that's fine too, we just need to make sure we can control the number.

3. If it's fine with 1 core, try to put your code into my schedules file (if it wants 2+, tell me and I'll modify the scheduler)  - 
  
     3.1 Create an array of input values (I suggest putting all parameters into one class, then  having an array of variables of that class)
     3.2 Modify your function to accept initial conditions as a parameter
     3.3 Modify your function to write results to some file with a label in the name
     3.4 Figure out how to send a variable of your class over MPI (it might be actually straightforward in python) 
     3.5 Replace workTimes with your initalConditions
     3.6 Replace sleep with your function (that now can accept initial conditions as a parameters and prints output into a its own file)
